# MedLens
MedLens is a smart assistant that scans a user's list of medications—either entered manually or extracted via image recognition from prescription labels—and checks for potential drug interactions and side effects. It cross-references with medical databases (e.g., DrugBank or openFDA) and uses NLP to explain the results in user-friendly language.
